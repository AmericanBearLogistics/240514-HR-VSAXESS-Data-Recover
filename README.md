# VSAXESS Data Retrieval with Oracle APEX PLSQL

This repository contains Oracle APEX PLSQL code to retrieve data from VSAXESS software. The data includes information on user management, device management, and user groups.

## Background

The project started at the end of April 2024 due to the admin desktop losing access to the saved password set by the previous HR personnel. Consequently, the IT team reinstalled the VSAXESS software and contacted the VSAXESS tech support group to reconnect devices. As part of the recovery process, historical datasets are being utilized to recover all managerial data.

## Contents

- `user_management_info.sql`: PLSQL code to retrieve user management information.
- `device_management_info.sql`: PLSQL code to retrieve device management information.
- `user_group_info.sql`: PLSQL code to retrieve user group information.

## Usage

1. Ensure Oracle APEX environment is set up.
2. Run the respective PLSQL scripts in Oracle APEX SQL Workshop.
3. Modify the scripts as needed to fit your specific database structure.
4. Retrieve and analyze the data as required.
